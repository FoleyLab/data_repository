A folder for .npy files!

Please use the following guidelines

- Add .npy files to the appropriate folder for the molecule they correspond to (e.g. .npy files for LiH go in the LiH/ folder)
- If a folder doesn't exist for your system, add one
- Ensure that the name of the .npy files is sufficiently descriptive, e.g. `LiH_r_1.4_6311g_fci_500_states_Dipoles.npy` indicates the LiH system with a bondlength of r = 1.4 Angstroms, the FCI/6-311G level of theory, and dipole moments computed between 500 electronic states
