# csv files go in this folder!
- Make sure your files are saved in comma separated value format and with a .csv file extension
- Make sure your files have no header or footer; in other words, your file should begin with the first line of data and end with the last line of data
- Make sure there are no new-lines or carriage returns at the end of your data file
